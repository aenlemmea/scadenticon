An (Github Style) identicon generator written in scala

== Plans :
* Better Color generator
* Add better config support


=== About
Scadenticon is a identicon generator written in scala which aims to replicate identicon generation (Github Style). 
The exact algorithm used by github to generate hash or the color is unknown so this only imitates the github style.

= To use :

* Open src/main/scala/prop and change settings in the settings file's field to your liking . Make sure to remove the angular brackets from the username and filename fields and do NOT use any special symbols, only allowed characters are [a-z and 1-9].

* Next , open the scadenticon folder, open Terminal/Windows Terminal and type :
----
sbt
----
* After sbt prompt appears type :
----
run
----
This should make a icon in your project folder. Enjoy !
The first build will be a bit slow , but subsequent builds will be blazing fast.

---
. Requirements : SBT and JDK (11, is what is used in this one)



_My first scala project so please be considerate :3_
